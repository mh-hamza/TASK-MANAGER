Task Manager App
Overview
This project is a Task Manager application built with React and Firebase. It allows users to manage tasks with full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality and supports real-time updates using Firebase Firestore. The app also includes user authentication via Firebase Authentication and a clean, responsive UI.

Features
User Authentication (Firebase)
Email/password login and sign-up functionality using Firebase Authentication.

Task Management (CRUD operations)
Create, view, edit, and delete tasks. Tasks are fetched from Firebase Firestore.

Real-Time Updates with Firebase
Real-time synchronization with Firebase Firestore ensures any changes to tasks are reflected instantly across all sessions.

Search Functionality
Filter tasks by title or description to easily find what you're looking for.

Responsive UI
The app is responsive and works seamlessly on both mobile and desktop devices.

Loading Spinner
A loading spinner is displayed while tasks are being fetched or when API calls are being processed.

This app uses React Context to manage the global state for tasks and user authentication.
It also supports real-time updates, meaning that tasks added or edited by one user will immediately reflect in other users' sessions.
